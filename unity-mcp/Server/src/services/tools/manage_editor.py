    description="Controls and queries the Unity editor's state and settings. Read-only actions: telemetry_status, telemetry_ping. Modifying actions: play, pause, stop, set_active_tool, add_tag, remove_tag, add_layer, remove_layer, deploy_package, restore_package, sync_csproj, undo, undo_action, redo. For prefab editing (open/save/close prefab stage), use manage_prefabs. deploy_package copies the configured MCPForUnity source folder into the project's installed package location (triggers recompile, no confirmation dialog). restore_package reverts to the pre-deployment backup. undo/redo perform Unity editor undo/redo and return the affected group name. Every mutating tool response carries an 'undo' object {action_id, group, name, undoable: true|false|\"partial\", note?}; undo_action with that action_id reverts exactly that one agent action, and is refused unless it is still the most recent undo step (so the user's later edits are never reverted) or when undoable is false (file changes). sync_csproj regenerates the external-editor .sln/.csproj files (reference source for C# code intelligence) and returns how many .csproj files exist afterwards; it drives the com.unity.ide.visualstudio generator directly, so it works even when no external IDE is installed on the machine.",
